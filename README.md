–Steve Jobs

2. #### 📆 Learn Consistently Through Notes

   > "If you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done."

3. #### 💡 Connect The Dots Through Insights

   > "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards."
–Steve Jobs
