# [Tue, Jan 7](day://2025.01.07) - Restoring a large snapshot into an autoscaling cluster should not run out of space #85568

[`#85568` Restoring a large snapshot into an autoscaling cluster should not run out of space](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/85568)

### Problem Statement

When restoring data from a snapshot (which is like a backup) into an Elasticsearch cluster that has autoscaling enabled, the cluster fails to scale up properly to meet the increased resource demand.

In a properly working system, the autoscaling feature should detect that more space is needed and automatically add more nodes to handle the increased demand. However, there's a timing and coordination issue occuring.

There are two errors:

1. "the node is above the low watermark cluster setting [...]"

Elasticsearch has a safety mechanism where it won't allocate new shards (piece of an index that is fully-functional and independent Lucene index, they enable horizontal scaling and parallelization) to nodes that are using more than the low watermark cluster setting (something like 85% of disk space). In this case, the node only has about 14.7% free space remaining.

2. "shard has failed to be restored from the snapshot [...] - manually close or delete the index [...] in order to retry to restore the snapshot again"

This indicates that hte restore operation failed because there wasn't enough space to allocate the shards.

Indeed, nodes run out of disk space, exceeding the low watermark threshold, and shard allocation fails.

The issue is a coordination between 3 systems:

1. The snapshot restore process that needs to bring back data.
2. The disk watermark protection system that prevents overloading nodes.
3. The autoscaling system that should add more capacity.

This is a significant issue because snapshot restores are often critical operations, especially in disaster recovery scenarios where reliability is important.

### Potential Solutions

- Improve Autoscaling responsiveness (improve prediction and scale up before disk watermarks are reached)
- Dynamic disk watermark adjustments (temporarily relax watermark thresholds)
- Pre-compute required disk space for a snapshot restoration and store it (before starting the process)
- Fix any bugs in this version
