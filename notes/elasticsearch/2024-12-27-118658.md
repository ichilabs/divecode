[ESQL: Skip lookup fields when eliminating missing fields](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/118658)

### What is ESQL?

The Elasticsearch Query Language (ES|QL) enables filtering, transforming, and analyzing data stored in Elasticsearch. Users can find specific events, perform statistical analysis, and generate visualizations.

### What is X-Pack?

X-Pack is a collection of features that enhance the capabilities of the Elastic core stack, including Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats. These features include security, alerting, monitoring, reporting, and machine learning. Originally offered as separate plugins, X-Pack is now included by default in the official Elastic Stack distribution.

X-Pack includes features such as Authentication & Authorization, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Watcher, Anomaly Detection, and ES|QL.

### What are the changes made?

The pull request updates the codebase to use the new `JOIN_LOOKUP_V7` capability across all relevant tests and logic paths, while also refining how missing fields are treated if they belong to a lookup index.

1. Capability upgrade from `JOIN_LOOKUP_V6` to `JOIN_LOOKUP_V7`
2. Test skips and assumptions updated to expect the presence of `JOIN_LOOKUP_V7`.
3. Updated `supportsIndexModeLookup()` to return false with a comment clearly clarifying that cross-cluster search (CCS) does not fully support the new capability yet.
4. Beyond the version bump for the new capability, there’s a subtle change in `ReplaceMissingFieldWithNull`. Fields originating from a lookup index don’t have any statistics. The optimizer will now no longer assume they’re missing and convert them to `null`.
