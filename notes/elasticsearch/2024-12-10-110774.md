# [Tue, Dec 10](day://2024.12.10) - [8.12] Document how to query for a specific feature within rank_features (#110749) #110774

### Problem Statement

[`rank_features`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rank-features.html) in Elasticsearch don't support `exists` queries. This creates challenges, especially when working with machine learning models like ELSER that output sparse vectors. When the inference pipeline fails during document indexing, we need a way to identify documents missing these fields as highlighted in the original issue.

### Issues

1. **Original Issue** ([rank_features fields should support exists queries #98096](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/98096)): when ML pipeline failures occur, there's no direct way to identify documents missing rank_features fields. → This makes it difficult to selectively reprocess only the affected documents.
2. **Solution PR** ([Document how to query for a specific feature within rank_features #110749](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/110749)): documents a workaround discovered by Ben for querying specific features and merged the change into `elastic:main`.
3. Backport PR ([[8.12] Document how to query for a specific feature within rank_features (#110749) #110774](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/110774)): brings the documentation changes to the 8.12 version of Elasticsearch.

### Proposed Solution

Ben discovered that while exists queries aren't supported, term queries can achieve similar results. To understand this:

1. **The Analogy**:
   - Think of a rank_features field as a dictionary
   - Each entry has a name (feature) and a numeric value
   - While you can't ask "does entry X exist?" (exists query)
   - You can ask "show me dictionaries with entry X" (term query)
1. **The Implementation**:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "topics": "economics"
    }
  }
}
```

### Documentation Changes

```plaintext
GET my-index-000001/_search {
  "query": { <6>
    "term": {
      "topics": "economics"
    }
  }
}

<1> Rank features fields must use the `rank_features` field type
<2> Rank features that correlate negatively with the score need to declare it
<3> Rank features fields must be a hash with string keys and strictly positive numeric values
<4> This query ranks documents by how much they are about the "politics" topic.
<5> This query ranks documents inversely to the number of "1star" reviews they received.
<6> This query returns documents that store the "economics" feature in the "topics" field.
```

The documentation changes add this as a sixth example (note the <6> marker), alongside other common rank_features use cases. The comment explains: "This query returns documents that store the 'economics' feature in the 'topics' field."
