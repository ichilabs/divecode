[`#48919` SlowSearchLog doesn't write the origin `source` to index_search_slowlog.log, it record the rewritable source](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/48919)

### What is Slow Log?

In Elasticsearch, the Slow Log is a specialized logging feature that records search or indexing operations that exceed certain time thresholds you configure. It’s primarily used for performance monitoring and troubleshooting.

### What is the problem?

If some query uses large `from` and `to` values (e.g. in a `range` query), the slow log might show `null` instead—making it harder to correlate the logged query with what was actually sent from the application.

### Why does this happen?

Elasticsearch rewrites certain queries internally, optimizing or normalizing them before execution. For large data ranges, it can rewrite the `from`/`to` to `null`.

The slow log records what Elasticsearch actually executes on each shard, which is the rewritten query–not the original request payload.

### How to confirm the issue?

1. **Create an index** with a `date-`type field.
2. **Insert a large number of documents** so the search is guaranteed to have enough data.
3. **Lower the `slowlog` threshold** to ensure even fast queries get logged.
4. **Execute a range query** with extremely large boundary values.
5. Check `index_search_slowlog.log` for the actual query that got executed, which should show `null` for `from` and `to`.
