# [Thu, Dec 5](day://2024.12.05) - apm-data: add event.ingested field to APM documents #117970

`Plugins`, `Integrations`, `APM`, `Elastic Agents`, `Ingest Pipelines`, `ECS`, `Fleet`

### Problem Statement

After version 8.15, the `event.ingested` field in APM documents no longer automatically gets populated. This issue arose after the migration of APM Data from integrations to plugins.

In the integration architecture, Fleet served as a centralized management system that automatically handled the population of fields. This process occurred at the integration layer before the data reached Elasticsearch.

In the plugin architecture, the automatic field population is lost because plugins operate differently. When APM became a plugin, it gained deeper integration with Elasticsearch’s core but lost the automated field population that Fleet previously handled.

The absence of this field affects:

1. Data retention management
2. Lifecycle policies
3. Audit trails
4. Data freshness tracking
5. Dependent system operations

### Proposed Solution

To address the issue, the `event.ingested` field is added to the generally shared mappings. This pipeline will automatically populate the event.ingested field during document processing, effectively restoring the functionality previously handled by Fleet’s asset management system.

This solution:

1. Maintains backward compatibility with existing systems
2. Preserves data consistency across the platform
3. Requires minimal changes to dependent systems
4. Aligns with Elasticsearch's plugin architecture
5. Provides a sustainable long-term approach to field management
