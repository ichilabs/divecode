# [Tue, Dec 31](day://2024.12.31) - Support Date Nanos for In function #118578

[`#118578` Support Date Nanos for In function](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/118578)

### Background

The Elasticsearch Query Language (ES|QL) provides a powerful interface for querying and manipulating data stored within Elasticsearch. One of the key field types in Elasticsearch is `date_nanos`, which supports timestamps with nanosecond precision. This level of precision is essential for use cases such as log data analysis, where events often occur within the same millisecond. Currently, ES|QL has partial support for `date_nanos` fields, but many critical functions, operations, and aggregations do not fully utilize the capabilities of date_nanos. This limits its usability for teams that rely heavily on precise timestamp data.

### Problem Statement

The lack of comprehensive support for `date_nanos` in ES|QL creates significant barriers for users who depend on high-precision timestamp data. While the field type is supported in Elasticsearch, its integration into ES|QL is incomplete.

The gaps include the `IN` operator that does not handle date_nanos seamlessly, leading to incorrect filtering or errors when attempting to match values against a list that includes nanosecond precision timestamps. This limitation is particularly problematic for datasets with high-frequency events, where precise filtering is essential.

The limitations reduce the effectiveness of ES|QL for critical use cases and diminish the overall user experience, especially for teams managing high-frequency event data.

To address the gaps and enable full support for `date_nanos` in ES|QL, multiple changes are proposed in the parent issue:

[`#109352` [ES|QL] Support date_nanos field type](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/109352)

### What is `IN` function?

`IN` is an operator that allows testing whether a field or expression equals an element in a list of literals, fields or expressions.

```plaintext
ROW a = 1, b = 4, c = 3
| WHERE c-a IN (3, b / 2, a)
```
