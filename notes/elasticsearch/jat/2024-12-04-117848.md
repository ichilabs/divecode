# [Wed, Dec 4](day://2024.12.04) - [8.x] ESQL Date Nanos Addition and Subtraction (#116839) #117848

Understanding ES|QL, `date_nanos` and Elasticsearch query languages.

### Overview

- PR backports date nanos addition/subtraction support to Elasticsearch 8.x (new feature)
- Originally merged into main branch (v8.18.0 and v9.0.0)
- Implements date math operations for date_nanos fields
- Focused on period and duration calculations, excluding date_diff functionality

### Date Types in Elasticsearch

#### Standard Date Type

- JSON lacks native date type
- Stored formats:
   - Formatted strings (e.g., "2024-12-04")
   - Milliseconds since epoch
   - Seconds since epoch
- All dates convert to UTC milliseconds
- Always returned as strings

#### Date Nanos Type

- Higher precision: nanosecond resolution vs millisecond
- Limited date range: 1970-2262
- Stored as nanoseconds since epoch
- Limitations:
   - Millisecond-only aggregations
   - Transform operations affected

### ES|QL

#### Previously

- Query DSL (JSON-based _search API)
- Painless scripting
- EQL for events
- External processing requirements

#### Key Features

- Unified pipeline processing
- Native execution without DSL translation
- Integrated search and aggregation
- Single interface for workflows
- Real-time transformations

#### Query Structure

- Starts with source commands:
   - FROM, ROW, SHOW
- Processing commands (pipe-separated):
   - LIMIT: Row restriction
   - SORT: Result ordering
   - WHERE: Data filtering
   - EVAL: Column calculations
   - STATS: Statistical analysis
   - BUCKET: Histogram generation
   - ENRICH: Data enrichment
