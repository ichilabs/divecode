# [Wed, Jan 8](day://2025.01.08) - Remove uses of ImmutableOpen*Map #86239

[`#86239` Remove uses of ImmutableOpen*Map](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/86239)

### Background

Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine that handles large volumes of data and queries. To meet the demands of performance and scalability, Elasticsearch has traditionally relied on a range of data structures–both from the Java Collections Framework (JCF) and from the HPPC (High-Performance Primitive Collections) library. HPPC once provided significant advantages in memory usage and execution over Java's built-in collections; however, over the past decade, improvements in the Java HotSpot compiler and JVM have narrowed or eliminated those advantages.

Elasticsearch depends on HPPC notably through `ImmutableOpenMap` and `ImmutableOpenIntMap` classes, which wrap HPPC's specialized maps. These classes appear widely throughout the codebase, influencing both internal and public APIs. Over time, this has caused confusion regarding which collections library to use, added complexity in code that must convert back and forth between HPPC and JCF collections.

### Problem Statement

HPPC was historically faster in certain contexts, but with ongoing improvements to the JVM and JCF, performance benefits are now unclear. In addition, the code that uses HPPC does not naturally integrate with standard Java interfaces (e.g Map, List, Set...), introducing friction and increasing maintenance overhead.

### Proposed Solution

Removing or replacing HPPC collections. The overarching meta-issue #84735, tracks removing HPPC issue. The current issue is a sub-issue focusing on removing `ImmutableOpenMap` and `ImmutableOpenIntMap` entirely.

The work is divided among several Elasticsearch modules: core server classes, tests, public APIs and other modules like xpack.
