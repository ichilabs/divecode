# [Tue, Dec 3](day://2024.12.03) - Support min_children & max_children for nested docs #10043

### Problem Statement

No direct way to filter parent documents based on the number of matching child documents. Queries like "find parents with at least X matching children" are unnecessarily complex.

The current workaround is complex and inefficient:

1. Use has_child query with constant_score
2. Configure score_mode as sum
3. Implement function_score to zero out scores below threshold.
4. Apply min_score parameter.

### Proposed Solution

Introduce `min_children`, `max_children` parameters providing a simpler syntax for child document counts.

### Joins, Nested Documents and Parent-Child Relationships

A relational database consists of linked tables with common columns called foreign key columns. A *JOIN* links data between tables based on the values of these common columns. ([source](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-basics/mysql-join/))

Elasticsearch is a distributed NoSQL datastore. It provides scalable alternatives to costly SQL-style joins:

- Nested Documents:
   - Pros: Fast read performance.
   - Cons: Requires full parent document update.
   - Best for: Small, relatively static child datasets.
- Parent-Child Relationships:
   - Pros:Flexible updates, independent document lifecycle.
   - Cons: Higher memory overhead, slightly slower queries.
   - Best for: Dynamic relationships with frequent updates.
