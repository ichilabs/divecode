[`#123784` client-go: reflector name defaulting seems broken by Go modules](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/123784)

### What is Kubernetes?

Containers revolutionized the way applications are packaged and deployed. However, in a production environment, managing containers and ensuring consistent uptime becomes complex. Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platfrom to manage containerized workloads and services. It simplifies challenges providing a framwork to:

- Handle scaling and failover
- Support various deployment patterns (e.g canary deployments)
- Manage distributed systems with resilience and efficiency

#### Key Features

Service discovery (exposing containers using DNS names or IPs) & Load balancing (distributing network traffic to ensure stability), storage orchestration (dynamically mounts storage systems), automated rollouts and rollbacks, automatic bin packing (allocates resources efficiently based on container needs (CPU, memory)), ...

Unlike traditional orchestration systems, Kubernetes doesn't execute predefined workflows. Instead, it uses independent control processes that continuously drive the system's state toward a user-defined desired state.

#### Components

Each Kubernetes cluster: Control Plane (manage the overall state of the cluster) + one or more worker nodes (run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment)

#### Objects

They are persistent entities ("record of intent" → desired state) in the Kubernetes system that are used to represent the state of the cluster. Specifically, they can describe what containerized applications are running (and on which nodes), the resources available to those applications and the policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance.

### API

The Kubernetes API lets you query and manipulate the state of objects in Kubernetes. The core of Kubernetes' control plane is the API server and the HTTP API that it exposes. The latter lets end users, different parts of the cluster, and external components communicate with one another.

Most operations can be performed using kubectl. Kubernets also provides a set of **client libraries (including go client library)**.

#### Workloads

A workload is an application running on Kubernetes. Workload (single or several components) run inside a set of pods. A pod represents a set of containers in the cluster.

Kubernetes pods have a defined lifecycle: `Pending` → `Running` (if at least one of its primary containers starts OK) → `Succeded` / `Failed` phases (depending on whether any container in the Pod terminated in failure).

### What is the problem?

The debug log lines in `client-go`'s `tools/cache/reflector.go` reference the file path where the reflector is running. Prior to Go modules, this path correctly appeared as `k8s.io/client-go/tools/cache/reflector.go`. However, when using Go modules, the log instead shows a module-based path such as:

```bash
pkg/mod/k8s.io/client-go@v0.29.2/tools/cache/reflector.go:229
```

This discrepancy is purely a cosmetic/logging issue—it does not affect functionality but can be misleading or confusing when reading the logs to locate the source file. The relevant logging code was introduced before Go modules existed and thus still assumes the older, pre-module path structure.
