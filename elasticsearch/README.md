# Elasticsearch

### What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is a powerful, distributed, and open-source search and analytics engine used by top organizations such as Uber, Microsoft, eBay, and Slack. It is used to store, retrieve, and analyze vast amounts of data in real time. It underpins everything from fast product searches to real-time log analytics, making it an essential technology in the modern data-driven landscape.

### Why this project?

I specialize in backend development, infrastructure, and cloud computing. During my internships at AWS, I worked on three impactful projects that aimed to enhance Amazon DynamoDB, the lightning-fast NoSQL database service trusted by industry giants such as Airbnb, Disney and Nike. Now, I am intrigued by Elasticsearch and am eager to contribute to its development. By doing so, I hope to enhance my skills and collaborate within a vibrant open-source community.
